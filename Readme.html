<p>LibVfd is a library that helps getting salvaged Vacuum Fluorescence Displays (VFDs) to work using an arduino.</p>
<h2 id="vacuum-fluorescent-displays-vfd">Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD)</h2>
<p>VFDs usually emit green light. They often can be found in harddisc recorders, dvd players, video cassette recorders, hifi audio devices, dash panels, digital clocks, or at cash desks. They might come with predefined symbols that usually include seven segment numbers and icons i.e. for power-on, play, stop, pause, stereo, etc. They might also come in form of alpha-numeric dot-matrix displays.</p>
<p>While Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are more popular, VFDs still are appreciated. Due to their high luminosity they are easier seen in bright sunlight and do not require additional lighting at night.</p>
<h2 id="creating-driver-circuits-using-libvfd">Creating driver circuits using LibVfd</h2>
<p>When buying VFDs they usually come including a driver circuit, that can be controlled using serial or parallel protocols like RS-232 or Hitachi HD44780 (just like most LCDs do).</p>
<p>Sometimes VFDs are offered without the driving circuitry. Also when salvaging VFDs from electronic devices, the driving electronics for them often cannot be reused.</p>
<p>LibVfd provides schematics and perfboard-layouts for creating the driver circuit required to run such bare-bone Vfds.</p>

<p>Vfds are directly heated vacuum tubes with an anode coated in a phosphorescent layer.</p>

<p>Described starting from the viewer first there is a covering glasslayer. Under the glass there are some heating wires, usually horizontally running from left to right. In normal operation the heating wires are not glowing or very barely glowing.</p>
