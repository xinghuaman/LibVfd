# LibVfd
LibVfd is a library that helps getting salvaged Vacuum Fluorescence Displays (VFDs) to work using an arduino.

## Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD)
VFDs usually emit green light. They often can be found in harddisc recorders, dvd players, video cassette 
recorders, hifi audio devices, dash panels, digital clocks, or at cash desks. They might come with predefined
symbols that usually include seven segment numbers and icons i.e. for power-on, play, stop, pause, stereo, etc. 
They might also come in form of alpha-numeric dot-matrix displays. 

While Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are more popular, VFDs still are appreciated. Due to their high luminosity 
they are easier seen in bright sunlight and do not require additional lighting at night.

When 
When salvaging 
VFDs from electronic devices the driving electronics for them often cannot be reused.
